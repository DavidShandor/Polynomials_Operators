Program Description:
This program represent a Polynomial class, which can do some aritmethic operator on polynomials. The type of the polynomial can be only int, double or float. 
The operators are:
[] : Return the cell of the array at the given index, and put in the value.
= : Put inside polynomial another one.
+ : Sum 2 (or more) polynomials.
- : Substract 2 (or more) polynomials.
* : Multiply 2 (or more) Polynomials.
+=, -=, *= : Sum, Substract and multiply THIS polynomial with OTHER polynomial.
<< : Build ostream object of the polynomial, ready to print.

Compilation:
Ctrl+Shift+B -> Build-> Continue without scanning the task output.

Launch the Program: 
Ctrl+F5     

Attached filed:
MakeFile, launch.json, tasks.json- Configuration files.
ex6_q2.cpp – The Main Program.
Polynomial.h – Polynomial header file. Include template class T. 


How to use the program:
to create new polynomial: Polynomial<Type> "name";
to initialize it: name[index] = T;
to do aritmethic operator (3 pol):  poly3 = poly1 (choose: +, -, *) poly2;
Or to do aritmethic operator(2 pol):  poly3 (choose: +=, -=, *=, =) poly2;
To print: cout << nameOfPolynomial.

NOTE:
This program is NOT dynamic program, which mean user can't set command while running.
